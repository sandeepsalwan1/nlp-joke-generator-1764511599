# Notes
- I went ahead and cloned the rJokesData repo to get the rJokesDataset. If we want to go back and get things such as upvotes, downvotes, and such,
I can definitely do that. But I think this is a good set to use for now, especially for making/training our models. We have the unprocessed json, and a processed train, test, and split set.

- For both the rJokesData and kaggle datasets, make sure to unzip the file beforehand!
- I did have to use this to push the large zip files: https://git-lfs.com/
